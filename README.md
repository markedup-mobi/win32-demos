# MarkedUp Win32 Demos

This repository contains two Win32 projects - a simple console project in C and another in C++; they are meant to illustrate how to use the MarkedUp C/C++ SDK in an easy-to-use context.

For best results, please let the console application run for a few seconds before exiting - this will give the network manager time to batch and confirm requests from MarkedUp's servers.

## Requirements
The Visual Studio solution file was created in Visual Studio 2013, but is currently set to use Visual Studio 2012 w/ XP support compiler settings. 

This can be modified at your discretion - it will not make an impact on the nature of the MarkedUp SDK calls themselves.

In order to run this demo, you must have:
- One or more [MarkedUp API Keys](https://markedup.com/new)
- Visual Studio 2012/13
- .NET 3.5 or later (will run without it, but you won't see any data on your dashboard)
